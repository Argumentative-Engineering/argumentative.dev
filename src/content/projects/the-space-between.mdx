Made as a finals project for College Physics. We were instructed to make a game that demonstrated the three laws of physics, so we made a narrative puzzle game set in space. <u>**In zero gravity, even moving an inch is a puzzle.**</u>

Lena, a woman in her forties, is both an astronaut and a marine biologist. She is one of the two astronauts sent to space for Project Hercules, yet another mission to look for potential homes for the human race. For the first part of the mission, she mans the command module, Helen, and undocks one of the landers, Obsidian, with her one and only co-astronaut inside it. All alone now, she does maintenance on Helen while waiting until she needs to land herself. A space rock hits the spacecraft, destroying Helen and disconnecting its second lander, Scoria.

Already lonely and miserable, Lena tries to move herself in zero gravity, all while still trying to convince herself with memories of Earth that her own life is worth saving.
