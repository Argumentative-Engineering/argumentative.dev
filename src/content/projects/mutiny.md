Pirate ships and bombs !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Take your anger out on your friends by — that's right — **BOMBING THEM!**

Mutiny is a local multiplayer game that can support up to TEN players!

A local multiplayer game inspired by <u>Smash Bros</u> and <u>Bomberman</u> well known even amongst fellow students due to its fun, casual, and collaborative play. This was originally a 2-day project, but is now being turned into a large-scale game because my team and I were offered funding for it.
